Up till now, my posts have been a bit unorganized. I have had a long standing issue that the posts I make on this blog sometimes feel esoteric, which has led me to be a bit disoriented in how to write posts. Should I keep in high-level technical details, like Terry Tao does in his posts? Would borderline insane (but fun) philosophical remarks be appropriate for articles that claim to have some level of scholarly value? Is it better if I keep posts "authentic" and write about "normal" things going on in my life?

These questions are what led me to a separation of church and state; for some time now I have been maintaining two websites: Lemonade and Orange Juice. However, the creation of the two sites didn't lead to real separation, something I was still hesitant about at heart.

I've decided to keep what is already here, but slowly shift the tone of future posts. I'll aim to reach a broader audience by writing on a larger variety of topics at a more general level, and keep blogs focused rather than brain-dumping jumbled streams of thought.

For the near future, I think I'll have a few types of posts:
- Life Updates
- Math/Science/Philosophy (more of a magazine vibe, with links to technical details on Orange Juice)
- Music
- Plants
since these are the things that matter to me most right now!

Looking forward to it!
