Up till now, my posts have been a bit unorganized. I have had a long-standing issue that the posts I make on this blog sometimes feel esoteric, which has led me to be a bit disoriented about how to write posts. Should I keep in high-level technical details, as Terry Tao does in his posts? Would borderline insane (but fun) philosophical remarks be appropriate for articles that claim to have some level of scholarly value? Is it better to keep posts "authentic" and write about "normal" things happening in my life?

In response to these questions, I drew a line between church and stateâ€”I've been maintaining two separate websites: Lemonade and Orange Juice. However, the creation of the two websites didn't lead to real separation, something I was still hesitant about at heart.

I've decided to keep what is already here, but slowly shift the tone of future posts. I aim to reach a broader audience by writing on a larger variety of topics at a more general level, keeping blogs focused rather than brain-dumping jumbled streams of thought.

For the near future, I think I'll have a few types of posts:
- Life Updates
- Math/Science/Philosophy (more of a magazine vibe, with links to technical details on Orange Juice)
- Music
- Plants
- Gym/Motivation/Nutrition

since these are the things that matter to me most right now!

Looking forward to it!
