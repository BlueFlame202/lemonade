Today, I finally revived the notes section of my website. I've been getting many requests for tutoring, which made me think about education. What concepts are important to teach, and what concepts are important to learn? And what's the best way to learn?

I decided to rebrand the section under the name "Alethia" as an allusion to the idea that it is the opposite of "Eureka". I think it's really common for us to feel that education should come through Eureka moments, but I feel like such moments are often moments of false confidence. True knowledge comes with patience and perserverence.

I hope it'll be cool! But now that I've also updated Orange Juice, I may move Aletheia there (merged with research and exposition) and instead use this blog for lifestyle things. Coming soon, I hope to revise my calendar from before and discuss a topic I've been thinking about a lot in the past two years: ritualism.
