In the upcoming days, I will take 2 day intervals to work on projects. Every two days, I will try to complete or make significant progress towards the completion of a project of my choice, and then publish it somewhere and make a YouTube video about the process. The idea is to do a sort of annealing: after sufficient exploration, I'll move to 5 day, 10 day, and longer intervals, converging on things that I prefer to work on.

Looking forward to the future.
