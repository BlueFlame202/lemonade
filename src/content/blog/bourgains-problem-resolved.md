Today I was reminded by a mentor of the importance of interacting with scientific and mathematical communities that we are interested in. I was inspired by them to take my relationship with research on a more livelihood level and to start reading and blogging more about magazines and general articles.

Already, I'm having a lot of fun and feel like I'm gaining a lot of inspiration! Today I read <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mathematicians-solve-multidimensional-shape-slicing-dilemma/">an article in the Scientific American by Max Springer</a> about a preprint from the end of last year by Boaz Klartag and Joseph Lehec which resolves the Bourgain slicing problem. Klartag told Scientific American: "If you believe in this so-called curse of dimensionality, you might just give up," but that he and Lehec "belong to a different school of thought." The curse of dimensionality seemed to me to be a widely accepted phenomenon and fact of life in the data science space, so a bold defiance of it seems cool and inspirational.

Taking a closer look at the preprint, the authors mention that the key technique involved in resolving Bourgain's problem is the idea of <i>stochastic localization</i>. I was intrigued by the use of probability measures in this seemingly geometric problem, the same ideology that made me enjoy reading about optimal transport. I plan to make a post about it on Orange Juice, so I'll update this post when that's done! Until then, check out the awesome article by Max Springer, as well as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15044">the preprint by Klartag and Lehec</a>!
