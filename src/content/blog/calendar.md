I've acquired quite a sizeable debt for this blog. This was something I forgave to pursue other goals in the past few years, but for the next few months, I will be working for myself to produce my best work. This will require diligence. 

The goal of this post is to lay out a calendar for posts. I will be working on this blog for 7 hours a week, and will aim to make two posts a week. Every Saturday post will be to work on my debt, while Wednesday posts will be more current.

**Weekly Post Dates:** Wednesday and Saturday<br/>
**Calendar of Posts:**

December 31st, 2025: ML Low Level Software
January 1st, 2026: Tales from Hartshine (exception, as something I've been working on)
January 3rd, 2026: Kernel Methods and Mercer's Theorem
January 7th, 2026: Contributing to Modular
January 10th, 2026: Entropy and Fisher Information
January 14th, 2026: To Be Decided
January 17th, 2026: Krylov Methods
January 21st, 2026: To Be Decided
January 24th, 2026: Rectified Flow
January 31st, 2026: What is $dx$?

March 7th, 2026: Game Theory Nuggets
April 10th, 2026: Beating `ollama` (goal, but this may not happen)

This is the schedule for now. I'll make further updates later!
