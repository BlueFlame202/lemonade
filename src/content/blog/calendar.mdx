I've acquired quite a sizeable "post-debt" for this blog: there are at least a dozen unpublished posts I'm halfway done with. This was something I forgave to pursue other goals in the past few years, but for the next few months, I will be working for myself to produce my best work. This will require diligence. 

The goal of this post is to lay out a calendar for posts. I will be working on this blog for 7 hours a week, and will aim to make two posts a week. Every Saturday post will be to work on my debt, while Wednesday posts will be more current.

**Weekly Post Dates:** Wednesday and Saturday<br/>
**Calendar of Posts:**

Posts have been postponed due to the new year, and I wanted to spend time with family. I probably should have anticipated that.
- January 2st, 2025: ML Low Level Software [Postponed due to the new year]
- January 10th, 2026: Tales from Hartshine [Postponed due to the new year + family time]
- January 10th, 2026: Kernel Methods and Mercer's Theorem [Postponed due to the new year + family time]
- January 8th, 2026: Contributing to Modular
- January 14th, 2026: Entropy and Fisher Information
- January 17th, 2026: To Be Decided
- January 21th, 2026: Krylov Methods

- March 7th, 2026: Game Theory Nuggets
- April 10th, 2026: Beating `ollama` (goal, but this may not happen)

This is the schedule for now. I'll make further updates later!

{/* I need to make a post about 
- the old days with well crafted and nicely formatted google docs
- simple analog things like jars of money or for storing fun activities/nice things
    - ties into ritualism and artisan-stuff!
