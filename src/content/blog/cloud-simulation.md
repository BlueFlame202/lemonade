I was just looking around for clues on how to make a cool cloud simulation when I stumbled across this guy's website: <a href="https://bradguesman.com/">Brad Guesman</a>. He has some cool projects, I especially thought the cloud simulation stuff looked really cool. I thought I'd make a post to save it for later, and who knows, maybe someone stumbling upon my website would enjoy his work too!
