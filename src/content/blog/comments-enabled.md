Check it out! I finally got comments working on this Astro website. This means we're pretty much back to my Wordpress days, but now with a better understanding of what's going on under the hood!

I wanted to allow people to comment unanonmyously, but I also want to prevent identity theft. To do this, I added Google authentication too using `auth-astro`! That was honestly a bit of a pain, but hey, this is an amazing feature because I can now release protected posts and pages, which will allow me to go more public while simultaneously remaining more private.

One consideration I made was having comments be reverse chronological and replies be chronological. Let me know what you think of that below! :)
