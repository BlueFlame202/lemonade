Check it out! I finally got comments working on this Astro website. This means we're pretty much back to my Wordpress days, but now with a better understanding of what's going on under the hood!

I wanted to allow people to comment unanonmyously, but I also want to prevent identity theft. To do this, I added Google authentication too using `auth-astro`! That was honestly a bit of a pain, I've learned my lesson to just read documentation directly instead of following outdated blog posts (this also made me think about how to write my own posts so they're actually useful).
