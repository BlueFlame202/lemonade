It's the day after my birthday, but it's kind of a bummer: in my opinion I didn't do well at all on the CS 162 Midterm 2.

It kind of sucks because I feel like I probably could've done well if I hadn't had taken up so many responsibilities for other classes, my club, and research. 

At the same time, ceasing to do those things would be like getting rid of a part of myself... I don't think that's really worth it.

The only solution is to get faster I guess.

That's the horrible thing about grades, it feels they immortalize who you are, giving a point estimate that doesn't reflect potential or growth. When you recieve a bad grade, it feels like being harmed for who you were in the past.

With good practice and planning, I'm sure it's possible to avoid these things. Somehow I've always had more discipline in saying that I will change my ways than in actually doing that... but that will be changing in the coming days.
