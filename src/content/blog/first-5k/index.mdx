Recently a friend of mine started running, so I decided to join in. At first I was running 2 miles at night whenever I could, but today I finally did a 5k, which was my goal for February!

Check out this badge I got on Strava:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <Image src={challenge} alt="challenge" layout="fullWidth" style="width: 40%; height: auto;" />
</div>
and also this cool dude who gave me a kudos on the run:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 1rem; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <Image src={dude} alt="dude" layout="fullWidth" style="width: 40%; height: auto;" />
</div>

This guy did a half-marathon morning run, isn't that crazy?! Exciting, and now I feel more motivated to accomplish some of my other goals this month.
