Do you play life to win? Or do you play to have fun?



Sometimes I question what I'm doing with my life. Right now I'm in college far from home, inevitably spending so much money for an "education". It's extraordinarily fun and interesting to learn about so much math, engineering, technology, art, and perspectives, but at the same time, I'm worried about if it was really worth it. 

The first thing that got me asking these painful questions was when everyone around me, from family to friends to strangers, immediately assumed whenever I talked to them that since I was studying math, I would either go into academia or finance. To be honest, I never really thought about those things going into college, I just liked math. 

The weight of figuring out what to *do* with all this math I was learning is pretty heavy though. And do I have to do anything with it?

I thought, if I've taken so much from society by coming here to one of the best universities in the nation for my selfish desire to learn, have fun, and enjoy my own life, I should probably do something to give back to everyone. Do I owe it back to society? Considering there are probably many other people who would have enjoyed these opportunities, and couldn't necesarily obtain them due to circumstance. 

Don't I owe it to them to make the condition of society better so that more people can enjoy the luxuries I've had?

To be honest, I always thought it would be easy to use math to change the world to make it a better place. There was a part of me that thought if I learned enough math, I would immediately be able to change the world and make everyone happier.

But it might be a bit more difficult than I thought. The world is a chaotic and unorganized place - there's just too much going on.

I read a quote the other day of a fictional character named Victoria Lucas, which I thought was interesting:
<p><dd><i>What horrifies me most is<br/>
      the idea of being useless:<br/>
      well-educated, brilliantly promising,<br/>
      and fading out into an <br/>
      indifferent middle-age.</i><br/>
      - Victoria Lucas</dd></p>

Isn't the whole point of education from a societal perspective to increase society's standard of living?

But also, what are the ways for people to contribute to people's standard to living? People seem to dislike big corporations and the government, but it sometimes feels like those are the places that do the most. Big corporations and large organizations aren't perfect... they're very far from that, yet they have a lot of power over society. So it's easy to make claims that they aren't as responsible as they should be, for the amount of power that they have.

Eh... at this point idek what I'm talking about, and I took a break to do some other stuff and meet friends lol. So maybe I'll continue this post another day.
