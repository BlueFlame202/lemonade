Recently, I read something interesting: apparently ketchup is so hard to get out of bottles because it primarily acts like a liquid under compression! It's an example of something called a "shear-thinning" fluid. I'm reading about complex fluids right now, which has been quite fun. I really wanted to start this earlier but somehow I never got to make the time for it. There's so much to learn, from fluids and numerics to probability theory to homology and modern geometry/topology, I guess I have to get much faster at learning if I want my freshman year dreams to come true.

In the meantime, I've also been enjoying the holiday season! This one has been a bit more tame than most, but relaxing nonetheless. Especially with all the media and politics in the air following election season and the shooting of Brian Thompson, I've had some time to think about what I believe in and who I am. And of course, the big question: what should I spend the rest of my life doing?

I don't know if I've gotten much clarity, but I guess I'll just have to keep meeting more passionate people to see what they're up to, and maybe get some inspiration! :-)
