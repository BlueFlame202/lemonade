Here's some music you can listen to while reading if you're logged into Spotify:
<div>

</div>

Last time, we made this definition:

**Definition.** Consider any Hermitian operator $A$. We say that an operator $L$ is **a ladder operator for $A$ of step size $c$** if 
<div style="text-align: center">$$[A, L] = cL.$$</div>

and showed the following basic results:

<div class="theorem">
**Theorem.** Consider any Hermitian operator $A$. If $L$ is a ladder operator for $A$ of step size $c$, then $L^\dagger$ is a ladder operator for $A$ of step size $-c^*$.
</div>

<div class="theorem">
**Corollary.** Suppose $A$ is a Hermitian operator and $L$ is a ladder operator for $A$ of step size $c$ where $c \in \R$. Then $[A, LL^\dagger] = 0$.
</div>

The goal is to obtain a result that somehow relates boundedness or boundary conditions restricting the eigenvalues of an operator to "discreteness" of said operator's eigenvalues. 

The crucial property of the ladder operator $L$ is as follows: if $v$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$, 
$$A(Lv) = (AL)v = ([A, L] + LA)v = cLv + LAv = cLv + \lambda Lv = (c+\lambda)(Lv)$$
so $Lv$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\lambda + c$.


Now, I've been thinking that we really should be choosing one individual sequence of eigenvectors. Namely, ignoring constants, applying ladder operators moves us from one eigenvector to the next. It is difficult to do any theorem by looking at all eigenvectors simultaneously. Instead, we can restrict our attention to one eigenvector $v$, and the resulting sequence of eigenvectors obtained by applying $L$ and $L^{\dagger}$. 

Consider some arbitrary eigenvector $v_0$ of $A$, and define $v_k = L^k v$ for $k \ge 0$ and $v_{-k} = (L^{\dagger})^k v$ for $k \le 0$.
