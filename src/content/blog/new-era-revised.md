Not too long ago, I made <a href="https://aathreyakadambi.vercel.app/blog/a-new-era">a post</a> that I wanted to make my posts on this blog less "esoteric" and more approachable. I also wanted to organize my posts more to be more focused. It all stemmed from a few questions:
1. What do I want to write/speak about?
2. What will others be interested in reading/hearing/discussing?
3. How can I be organized and focused while not writing about only one thing?

At the time, I was doing research and slowly becoming anxious about graduate school and my lack of publications. I was also realizing that many readers of my blog might not not be interested in mathematical details, but might find beauty in unconventional or insightful results. In that post, I attempted to change the character of Lemonade itself. This confused me because it meant discontinuing or changing the character of posts I was looking forward to.

At the time, I incorrectly conflated the answers to 1 and 2. I thought that I could only write about the intersection of 1 and 2, and I also made the mistake of assuming I knew what the answer to each of those questions was.

One thing I realized is that the separation I was looking for could be aided by a better UI. I've made several changes to my blog to address this.

## Categories

The first thing to notice is the new categories! This way, I can organize my writing into topics, so that interested readers can better find what they are looking for. This handles question 2 above, while also allowing for a broad answer to 1. Additionally, by thinking about which category I'd like to focus on in my life at the moment, it also helps answer 3. Right now, we take a union of posts from each category selected, but in the future I may consider supporting intersection, which could be interesting.

With the above changes, I added some categories which will be targeted towards certain audiences. For example, after taking a creative writing class this fall, I hope to add creative writing posts to "artistic", and "ml" might be a topic of interest to an undergraduate reading group I joined.

## Pagination

The second thing to notice is the use of pagination. This is a feature I've been meaning to implement for a while. This way, images can load faster (though lazy image loading was already enabled). It's symbolic of an effort to be focused and see less at one time, and also a way of reducing the half-life of my incorrect statements.

With all these changes, I'm looking forward to getting back to writing about what I enjoy! :)
