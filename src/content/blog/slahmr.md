Happy New Year! I'm a bit late... unforunately. My backlog of blog posts has grown astonishingly, all because I got slightly stuck on my second ladder operators post! I'm really close to being done, but the proof of the result is evading me. But now I have to make this one, which makes me feel guilty about the other planned ones which are nearly done but not ready yet... maybe at the end of this post I'll sketch out some of the posts I plan to finish up and release in this next week. :-)

In any case, in the last two days, I was playing around with this thing called SLAHMR! It's essentially a model for pose detection, but it's especially cool because it also models the motion of the camera itself, along with a ground plane!

Experiments with SLAHMR
-------------------------

For my experiments, I used three 3-second clips: one of myself shoveling snow (yes, it's snowing right now in New Jersey!), one of my brother and dad coming back from my brother's bike race, and one of a crowd of people in SF enjoying the Fleet Week air show.

January Planned Posts
-------------------------

The issue with some of these posts is that after I've figured out what I want to write about and lay it out in my head too well, actually writing it out becomes a pain! And also, everything kind of temporarily slowed down in early November because I decided to go back to a Pomodoro schedule for the rest of the semester.

But... now with the new year and all, I promise to be more on top of my posts ðŸ¤§, especially in this next week so that I can get it all out of the way and out of my system before the semester starts!

**Funny/Chill Posts:**
1. 

**Math Posts:**
1. Motivating Ladder Operators II: Boundedness of the spectrum of an operator might imply discretness of the point spectrum (and maybe even the other parts of the spectrum?). I really believe in this result, even if the true one might have extra conditions.
2. What is dx: Finally, I think I've come to better understand variational methods, what differentials really mean, forces, energy, and gradient descent. (Oh boy, this might be a long post)
