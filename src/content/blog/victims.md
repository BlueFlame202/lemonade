Recently, the death of Brian Thompson has been celebrated throughout American social media, and Luigi Mangione has been lifted to fame as a hero. In my view, we've traded life and temporary freedoms for awareness: not a great trade. It feels to me that someone died so the rest of the country could get just a feeling that something has happened, while really, nothing has. Instead of celebrating these moments, we should consider these events more seriously, and maybe also actually enact changes that we want to see.

Luigi acknowledges the complexity of his actions in his own Goodreads post. He discusses Theodore Kaczynski:
- As "a violent individual - rightfully imprisoned - who maimed innocent people."
- "[These actions] are more accurately seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary."

He even added:
- "You may not like his methods, but to see things from his perspective, it's not terrorism, it's war and revolution."

Not sure how innocent his victims were here, but while Mangione's words in his review justify his choices, they don't convey enthusiasm for the path he took. Violence, even when justified by extreme circumstances, is a tragic failure of dialogue and policy.

And how many of us would do what he has done? We wouldn't (and shouldn't) because at the end of the day, "awareness" without presenting solutions or change isn't worth human lives. Inciting violence is not something to be proud of. If unavoidable, it must be done with our heads bowed down.

It's worth noting that even wealthy and morally gray individuals can be victims. After all, many Americans consider themselves victims of corporate greed and those in power, yet we are in one of the wealthiest and most morally ambiguous nations. It's all just a bit hypocritical.

I understand the anger and frustration stemming from repeated systemic injustices, and I want to resolve these problems too, as quick as we can. But instead of being overly enthusiastic about morally gray activism, I think we should focus on cultivating a culture that engages in more open discussion and is more aware when people without loud voices speak, so that they do not feel forced to make victims of themselves and others.
