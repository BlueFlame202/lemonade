There are a few things, Locally Trivial Bundles and Harewicz fibrations, which are both examples of Serre fibrations.

Interestingly, he jumped to Serre fibrations (9.4) right hafter introducing locally trivial bundles. Just kidding, 9.2 basically covers it without saying it.

He then showed the equivalence between three different definitions of the Serre fibration, and then did Feldbau's Lemma.

<div class="theorem">
**Feldbao's Lemma.** A locally trivial bundle ofver $I^n$ is trivial.
</div>

After this, we discussed Horewicz Fibrations AKA strong Serre fibrations. The CHP holds for all $Z$ (not only CW-complexes).

Somehow, naturality actually feels natural now. I remember one year ago it made no sense whatsoever, but now it just feels like I was blind back then.
