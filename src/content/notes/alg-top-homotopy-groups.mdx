$\pi_n(X,x_0) = \pi_b((S^n,0), (X,x_0))$. Note that $\pi_0(X,x_0)$ is the number of path-connected components of $X$.

He then explained the pictures from Fig 37 and Fig 38 in the book and basically section 8.1.

Depednence on Base Points
----------------------------

If we have another base point $x_1$ and a path from $x_0$ to $x_1$ $\gamma$, we get a map $\pi_n(X,x_0)\xrightarrow{\gamma} \pi_n(X,x_1) \xrightarrow{\tilde{\gamma}} \pi_n(X,x_0)$. 

We introduced many algebraic invariants but we can't compute many of them unless the space is trivial, so let's look at a covering $(T,t_0) \rightarrow (X,x_0)$. In the theory of coverings we showed that mappings $p : (T,t_0)\rightarrow (X,x_0)$ are injective. This is because if a loop is contractible in $(X,x_0)$, we can use the homotopy lifting lemma to lift this homotopy up to $T$, and then because the fiber is discrete, we get the same point up there so that the other loop upstairs is also contractible. From this, we get that $p_* : \pi_n(T,t_0) \hookrightarrow \pi_n(X,x_0)$ is injective for $n \ge 1$. It turns out for $n \ge 2$, it is also surjective.

{/* Remember that construction for showing that n torus is covered by a k torus, I should somehow make that quotienting and stuff more rigorous. Apparently $\pi_n(three torus) = 0$ and youcan also extract that from complex analysis because it says something (Riemann mapping theorem) CP1 or C or P, and for tori it is C or unit disk so they are both contractible */}

Relative Homotopy Groups
----------------------------

He discussed some stuff from this section.


The Reason This Was introduced
-------------------------------
This isn't necessarily helpful for computations or anything, but it let's us make the long exact homotopy sequence.

He wrote something about $A \xhookrightarrow{i} X$ and $(X,x_0,x_0) \xrightarrow{j}(X,A,x_0)$.

$$\pi_0(X)\xleftarrow{i_*}\pi_0(A)\xleftarrow{\partial} \pi_1(X,A) \xleftarrow{j_*}\pi_1(X) \xleftarrow{i_*}\pi_1(A) \leftarrow \pi_2(X,A)\leftarrow \dots$$
</center>

$$\dots \xleftarrow{i_*} \pi_{n-1}(A)\xleftarrow{\partial} \pi_n(X,A)\xleftarrow{j_*}\pi_n(X) \xleftarrow{i_*}\pi_n(A) \xleftarrow{\partial}\pi_{n+1}(X,A) \leftarrow$$
