Let $\pi_1(U_1 \cup U_2, x_0) = Z$. We also have $\pi_1(U_1 \cup U_2, x_0) = \pi_1(U_1,x_0) * \pi_1(U_2, x_0)$. A loop in the intersection can be represented as a loop in $U_1$ or a loop in $U_2$. So if you know the generators and relations for both groups, you can take union of generators and union of relations but add relations to ensure that loops in the intersection will be same.

We want $U_1 \cap U_2$ are path connected, and it doesn't hurt to assume $X$ is also path-connected, it ends up being that everything is path connected. Now the next thing is to prove the theorem.

He keeps saying groups and loops which rhyme and I got a little bit confused to be honest because he said green group, green loop, yellow group, yellow loop, and all I'm understanding is Dr. Seuss (jk, I love this class).

I shouldn't have written that last joke because I'm already behind again.

Applications of Van Kampen's Theorem
------------------------------------------

Let $Y = X \cup D^n$, $\phi : \partial D^n = S^{n-1} \rightarrow X$. We have a map $\pi_1(X,x_0) \xrightarrow{i_*}\pi_1(Y,x_0)$, iso if $n \ge 3$ and epi if $n = 2$, $\ker i_*$ is generated by the conjugacy class $[\varphi]$ of $\varphi$. We find that the fundamental group of $Y$ is the same as that of $X$ via van Kampen's theorem for $n \ge 3$, or smth.

**Strat.** As a corollary of the above, since $\pi_1(X^{CW},x_0) = \pi_1(\text{sk}_2X,x_0) = \pi_1(\vee_{\alpha \in I}S_\alpha^1 \cup_{\varphi_\mu}D_\mu^2$, Van Kampen's theorem tells us that this is just the free group of stuff $F_I$ quotiented by the relations which are the attatching maps $\varphi_\mu : \partial D_\mu^2 \rightarrow \vee_\alpha S_\alpha'$.

You can actually prove the application without van Kampen's theorem, which turns out to be useful, so let's do it. It's in the spirit of the free point lemma and cellular approximation.

Loops are maps of sides and homotopies are maps of squares or disks and stuff? We then apply Sard's lemma. "One of the few theorems that makes analysis meaningful, something that you need to prove by hand."

Let us now do braid group $Br_3$. This is polynomials of degree three with distinct roots. We want $\mathbb{C}^3 \backslash \Delta^2 \cong \mathbb{C}^1 \times (\mathbb{C}^2\backslash\Delta^1)$. by translating the roots.
