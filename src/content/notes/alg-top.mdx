I'm taking algebraic topology by Professor Givental! The goal of the class is to cover a dense subset of Chapters 0 through 2 of Fomenko and Fuchs's *Homotopical Topology*.

If you don't know what topological spaces, they are just basic operations + classical spaces. What we will do today is classical spaces.
