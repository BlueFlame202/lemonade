This class looks suuuper interesting I really want to take it tbh.

Assignments take up 1/3 of your grade and people do really well on the other stuff, so it's a very big part of your grade and important to take seriously.


Funny thing she said, if two students make th exact same mistakes, then it will raise some suspicion. But considering that this class is literally about whether we can even draw that conclusion, that's somewhat ironic.

Hallucination of Chat. I think it would be interesting to bring my feature token research stuff in conjunction with this class. Interesting topic, much to be explored and learned, the prof is on the same page on thsee things as we are. she brought up this topic because there is a question about what extent we can use generative ai tools on assignments and final papers and stuff. The rule for this class is that you are not allowed to use any generative AI tools for any of your assignments.

There will be a few prompts for the essay, but if you want to do your own thing, just talk to us. I could do this thing about whether LLMs have logic based features :eyes:, although to be honest i dont know if it would be as opinionated as she wanted it to be.

This fall I'm thinking of taking a philosophy of probability class.

*Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one.* - (probably) Voltaire.

<div class="remark">
**Remark.** Philosophers be like: I have absolutely no clue if the sun will rise tomorrow or if I will eat dinner or anything to be honest. Ppl also be asking what it means for evidence to confirm or disconfirm a hypothesis. And what *are* probabilities? Ok, that last question is pretty interesting. How should we make decisions? How do we understand probability and ethics? I feel like I'm making fun of myself by making fun of these questions.

We can actually adjust the syllabus along the way based on what people are interested in! :D I might actually make use of this feature hehehe.

**Definition.** An ***argument*** consists of a set of premises and conclusions. The premises and conclusions are ***propositions***: claims that can be true or false.

**Definition.** An argument is ***deductively valid*** if it is impossible for its premises to be true and its conclusion to be false, i.e., it is truth-preserving. The truth of the premises sort of gets passed down to the conclusion.

The majority of this class will not be about deductive logic, but rather *inductive logic*! Exciting! :D
